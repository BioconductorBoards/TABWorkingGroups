Project management for TAB project working groups

Working groups / committees are defined in the TAB Governance document http://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/TAB-Governance.pdf section on ‘Committees and Working Groups of the Board’. Working groups have a specific short term goals / deliverables they work toward (‘create a code of conduct’, ‘update package review process’, ‘develop a strategy for coordinating CAB / TAB / Core leadership’) and then disband.  Committees have long-term standing to provide strategic guidance (‘Education and Outreach’; maybe ‘CoC committee’) meeting annually to review CoC status, plus ad hoc to address issues arising.
